Hello, Website!

For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html.

Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are _not_ based on **blogdown**. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use **blogdown** instead: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown.

Este es mi primer documento 
```{r,include=TRUE}
library(maps)
library(terra)
a<-rast('/home/nihelruiz/Documents/2024/sissa_30/SPI01-PERSIANN_202001.tif')
plot(a)
b<-rnorm(300)
plot(b,t='l')
```
